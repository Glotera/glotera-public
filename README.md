## üß† Overview
Glotera is a cross-application translation assistant for macOS that allows you to quickly translate and replace the original text in any input field or selected text.It supports multiple triggering methods, suitable for both input and reading scenarios.


## üöÄ How to Use
### üî§ Input Translation
- After entering content in any input field, specify the target language (100+), and it will automatically translate and replace the original text.
- Supports the following triggering methods:
  - Type @language code or #language code (e.g., @en or #ja), then double-click the spacebar to initiate the translation.

  - Use the mouse or Cmd+A to select all input content, then click "Translate to" in the pop-up menu or any other language you wish to translate to.
